        <h1>P6Spy Installation</h1><p>This installation documentation contains instructions for installing P6Spy with various application servers. In addition, it contains general installation instructions for application servers not listed and applications that do not use application servers. Keep in mind that the <a href="install.htm#unspec">Unspecified Application Server</a> instructions do not contain details specific to your application server. Use them only as a guideline. If you create instructions for other application servers, send us a copy for possible publication in the documentation.</p><p>The installed P6Spy software offers many configuration options. See <a href="other.htm">Common Property File Settings</a> for additional information.</p><div class="section"><h2>JBoss<a name="JBoss"></a></h2><p>The following sections contain specific information on installing P6Spy on JBoss 2.x and JBoss 3.x.</p><div class="section"><h3>JBoss 2.x<a name="JBoss_2.x"></a></h3><p>The following instructions were tested with various JBoss versions ranging from JBoss 2.2.2-2.4.4 with Jakarta Tomcat 3.2.2-4.0.1 integration. To install P6Spy on JBoss 2.x, complete the following steps:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
  <li>Extract the <b>p6spy-install.jar</b> file.&#160;The<b> p6spy-install.jar</b> file contains <b>p6spy.jar</b> and <b>spy.properties</b>.</li>
  <li>Move the <b>p6spy.jar</b> file to the ext directory. An example of the path to your ext directory is C:\JBoss-2.2.2_Tomcat-3.2.2\jboss\lib\ext.</li>
  <li>Move the <b>spy.properties</b> file to the db directory, which is part of the JBoss classpath<b>.</b> An example of the path to your db directory is C:\JBoss-2.2.2_Tomcat-3.2.2\jboss\db.</li>
  <li><p>Modify the<b>jboss.jcml</b> file in the Tomcat conf directory to use the P6Spy driver, by removing your existing driver from the Drivers attribute and replacing it with the P6Spy driver. An example of an edited <b>jboss.jcml</b> file follows:</p>
  <div class="source"><pre>&lt;mbean code=&quot;org.jboss.jdbc.JdbcProvider&quot; name=&quot;DefaultDomain:service=JdbcProvider&quot;&gt;
  &lt;attribute name=&quot;Drivers&quot;&gt;com.p6spy.engine.spy.P6SpyDriver&lt;/attribute&gt;
&lt;/mbean&gt;
</pre></div></li>
  <li><p>Modify the realdriver line in the <b>spy.properties</b> file to reflect the wrapped database driver. An example of a modified realdriver line follows:</p>
  <div class="source"><pre>realdriver = oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver
</pre></div></li>
</ol><p>Installation is complete. When you run your application, a spy.log file is generated in the bin directory of the JBoss server. The log file contains a list of all of the database statements executed. You can change both the destination of spy.log and what it logs by editing the spy.properties file (see Common Property File Settings).</p></div><div class="section"><h3>JBoss 3.x<a name="JBoss_3.x"></a></h3><p>(Contributed by Alan Arvesen, IronGrid)</p><p>The following instructions were tested with JBoss 3.0.4 with Jetty integration. For these instructions, P6Spy assumes that you are using the default server residing in JBOSS_DIST\server\default, where JBOSS_DIST is the directory in which JBoss is installed. These instructions are intended for wrapping driver services, not XADataSource services. To install P6Spy on JBoss 3.x, complete the following steps:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
  <li>Extract the p6spy-install.jar file. The p6spy-install.jar file contains p6spy.jar and spy.properties.</li>
  <li>Move the p6spy.jar file to the lib directory. An example of the path to your lib directory is C:\java\jboss-3.0.4\server\default\lib.</li>
  <li><p>Add spy.properties to your JBoss classpath. By default, the JBoss classpath set up by run.bat only points to tools.jar and run.jar. You may need to add a directory, via JBOSS_CLASSPATH, to this path. An example of an edited JBoss classpath follows:</p>
  <div class="source"><pre>C:\&gt; set JBOSS_CLASSPATH=C:\java\jboss-3.0.4\server\default\db

C:\&gt; copy C:\java\p6spy\spy.* C:\java\jboss-3.0.4\server\default\db
</pre></div></li>
  <li><p>Create a p6spy-service.xml file in JBOSS_DIST\server\deploy. Set the config-property element named DriverClass to P6SpyDriver in p6spy-service.xml, by basing a new XML file on one of the examples in the JBOSS_DIST\docs\examples\jca directory. You can also configure JndiName and ConnectionURL for your specific implementation. An example of the pertinent portions (not the complete XML file) of a p6spy-service.xml file follows:</p>
  <div class="source"><pre>&lt;attribute name=&quot;JndiName&quot;&gt;MySqlDS&lt;/attribute&gt;
&lt;attribute name=&quot;ManagedConnectionFactoryProperties&quot;&gt;
&lt;properties&gt;
&lt;config-property name=&quot;ConnectionURL&quot; type=&quot;java.lang.String&quot;&gt;jdbc:mysql://localhost/localdb&lt;/config-property&gt;
&lt;config-property name=&quot;DriverClass&quot;type=&quot;java.lang.String&quot;&gt;com.p6spy.engine.spy.P6SpyDriver&lt;/config-property&gt;
</pre></div></li>
</ol><p>Note: Make sure there is not a service that explicitly loads the wrapped driver. A service of this type will load the specified driver before P6SpyDriver, resulting in unwrapped connections. Modify the realdriver line in the spy.properties file to reflect the wrapped database driver. An example of a modified realdriver line follows:</p>
<div class="source"><pre>    realdriver=org.gjt.mm.mysql.Driver
</pre></div><p>Installation is complete. When you run your application, a log file (spy.log) is generated in the bin directory of the JBoss server. The log file contains a list of all of the database statements executed. You can change both the destination of spy.log and what it logs by editing the spy.properties file (see Common Property File Settings).</p></div></div><div class="section"><h2>Orion<a name="Orion"></a></h2><p>The following instructions were tested with Orion. To install P6Spy on Orion, complete the following steps:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
  <li>Extract the p6spy-install.jar file. The p6spy-install.jar file contains p6spy.jar and spy.properties.</li>
  <li>Move p6spy.jar and spy.properties to the orion-home\lib directory, where orion-home is the directory in which Orion is installed. An example of the path to your orion-home\lib directory is C:\orion\lib.</li>
  <li><p>Modify the connection-driver line in data-sources.xml to use P6SpyDriver. data-sources.xml resides in orion-home\config. An example of an edited data-sources.xml file follows:</p>
  <div class="source"><pre>&lt;data-source
class=&quot;com.evermind.sql.DriverManagerDataSource&quot;
name=&quot;Hypersonic&quot;
location=&quot;jdbc/HypersonicCoreDS&quot;
xa-location=&quot;jdbc/xa/HypersonicXADS&quot;
ejb-location=&quot;jdbc/HypersonicDS&quot;
connection-driver=&quot;com.p6spy.engine.spy.P6SpyDriver&quot;
username=&quot;sa&quot;
password=&quot;&quot;
url=&quot;jdbc:HypersonicSQL:./database/defaultdb&quot;
inactivity-timeout=&quot;30&quot;
/&gt;
</pre></div></li>
  <li><p>In the example installation outlined above, Orion cannot locate spy.properties because of the classpath that Orion uses. Use the -D option to tell Orion where the property file resides by running Orion using the following command:</p>
  <div class="source"><pre>java -Dp6.home=c:\orion\orion\lib -jar orion.jar
</pre></div></li>
  <li><p>Modify the realdriver line in the spy.properties file to reflect the wrapped database driver. (This is the original value specified in connection-driver.) For example, if Hypersonic (the default database) was the original connection-driver value, the realdriver value is set to org.hsql.jdbcDriver.</p></li>
</ol><p>Installation is complete. When you run your application, a log file (spy.log) is generated in the orion-home directory of the Orion server. The log file contains a list of all of the database statements executed. You can change both the destination of spy.log and what it logs by editing the spy.properties file (see Common Property File Settings).</p></div><div class="section"><h2>Jakarta Tomcat<a name="Jakarta_Tomcat"></a></h2><p>The following instructions were tested with Jakarta Tomcat 3.x. Note that since you typically write or otherwise obtain your own Connection Pool when using Tomcat, these instructions will differ by application. To install P6Spy on Jakarta Tomcat, complete the following steps:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
  <li>Extract the p6spy-install.jar file. The p6spy-install.jar file contains p6spy.jar and spy.properties.</li>
  <li>Move the p6spy.jar and spy.properties files to the lib directory. An example of the path to your lib directory is C:\jakarta-tomcat-3.2.1\webapps\p6\WEB-INF\lib.</li>
  <li><p>Modify Tomcat to use P6SpyDriver. Tomcat applications obtain their JDBC connection in a variety of ways. Most applications have the database driver name externalized as a configuration parameter. For example, in your web.xml file (which resides in C:\jakarta-tomcat-3.2.1\webapps\p6\WEB-INF) you may have something similar to the following:</p>
  <div class="source"><pre>&lt;init-param&gt;&lt;param-name&gt;databaseDriver&lt;/param-name&gt;&lt;param-value&gt;org.gjt.mm.mysql.Driver&lt;/param-value&gt;&lt;/init-param&gt;
</pre></div></li>
</ol><p>In this above case, the databaseDriver parameter has a value of org.gjt.mm.mysql.Driver, which is the MySQL? driver. Wherever this configuration information is stored, change the driver name (org.gjt.mm.mysql.Driver, in our example) to com.p6spy.engine.spy.P6SpyDriver, as in the following example:</p>
<div class="source"><pre>    &lt;init-param&gt;&lt;param-name&gt;databaseDriver&lt;/param-name&gt;&lt;param-value&gt;com.p6spy.engine.spy.P6SpyDriver&lt;/param-value&gt;&lt;/init-param&gt;
</pre></div>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
  <li><p>Enable Tomcat to locate spy.properties. While all of the JAR files in your lib directory are, by default, included in Tomcats classpath, the lib directory itself is not. This means Tomcat will not be able to find your spy.properties file, which will result in an error. So, you must include spy.properties in the Tomcat classpath. Use the TOMCAT_OPTS environment variable to specify the location of the spy.properties file. An example of the edited TOMCAT_OPTS environment variable follows:</p>
  <div class="source"><pre>SET TOMCAT_OPTS=-Dp6.home=C:\jakarta-tomcat-3.2.1\webapps\p6\WEB-INF\lib
</pre></div></li>
  <li><p>Modify the realdriver line in the spy.properties file to reflect the wrapped database driver. An example of a modified realdriver line (using MySQL as the driver) follows:</p>
  <div class="source"><pre>realdriver = org.gjt.mm.mysql.Driver
</pre></div></li>
</ol><p>Installation is complete. When you run your application, a log file (spy.log) is generated in the directory from which you launched the application. The log file contains a list of all of the database statements executed. You can change both the destination of spy.log and what it logs by editing the spy.properties file (see Common Property File Settings).</p></div><div class="section"><h2>JOnAS EJB<a name="JOnAS_EJB"></a></h2><p>(Contributed by Fran&#xfffd;ois Exertier, JOnAS Opensource EJB Server team)</p><p>The following instructions were tested with JOnAS 2.3.x. To install P6Spy on JOnAS EJB, complete the following steps:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
  <li>Extract the p6spy-install.jar file. The p6spy-install.jar file contains p6spy.jar and spy.properties.</li>
  <li>Put the p6spy.jar file in the classpath of the JOnAS EJB server. For example, if p6spy.jar is in the /opt/Provider6 directory, add /opt/Provider6/p6psy.jar to the XTRA_CLASSPATH environment variable or directly edit the config_env script.</li>
  <li>Move spy.properties to a directory which is part of your classpath. It is recommended that you move it to the directory where your jndi.properties file resides.</li>
  <li><p>Modify the datasource.properties file (where datasource is the name of the data source) by replacing the database driver classname with the P6Psy database driver classname in the datasource.classname property. For example, the Oracle1.properties file delivered with JOnAS should be updated by replacing oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver with com.p6spy.engine.spy.P6SpyDriver. An example follows:</p>
  <div class="source"><pre>datasource.name   jdbc_1
datasource.description  &quot;Standard jdbc driver for Oracle&quot;
datasource.url   jdbc:oracle:thin:scott/tiger@maltes:1521:ORA1
datasource.classname com.p6spy.engine.spy.P6SpyDriver
...
</pre></div></li>
</ol><p>Note: Database access configuration within JOnAS is described in a DataSource property file, such as Oracle1.properties. Refer to the JOnAS Bean Programmers Guide for more details.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
  <li><p>Modify the realdriver line in the spy.properties file to reflect the wrapped database driver. An example of a modified realdriver line follows:</p>
  <div class="source"><pre>realdriver = oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver
</pre></div></li>
</ol><p>Installation is complete. When you run your application, a log file (spy.log) is generated in the directory from which you launched the application. The log file contains a list of all of the database statements executed. You can change both the destination of spy.log and what it logs by editing the spy.properties file (see Common Property File Settings).</p></div><div class="section"><h2>BEA WebLogic<a name="BEA_WebLogic"></a></h2><p>The following sections contain specific information on installing P6Spy on BEA WebLogic Portal 4.0, BEA WebLogic Server 6.1, and BEA WebLogic 5.1.</p><p>Note: IBM? Cloudscape does not work with P6Spy and BEA WebLogic. However, Cloudscape does work with P6Spy when using the J2EE reference implementation server. The following suggestion was submitted by Adrian Fletcher: I may be wrong but I suspect the problem with Cloudscape and WebLogic is that both drivers end up registered against the same URL. I seem to remember that the best trick for avoiding this is mangling the URL. If you instruct users to prepend p6spy: to their URL and then remove it in your wrapped file, it should work in more cases. You can do this with the useprefix option. If anyone has an opportunity to validate this, please drop us a line with updated information.</p><div class="section"><h3>BEA WebLogic Portal? 4.0<a name="BEA_WebLogic_Portal_4.0"></a></h3><p>(Contributed by Philip Ogren, BEA) The following instructions were tested with WebLogic Server 6.1 Service Pack 2 with WebLogic Portal 4.0 Service Pack 1 running on Microsoft&#xfffd; Windows&#xfffd; using the following:</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
  <li>Extract the p6spy-install.jar file. The installation file contains p6spy.jar and spy.properties.</li>
  <li>Run the WebSphere Administration tool by logging in to <tt>http://localhost/9090/admin</tt>.</li>
  <li>Under the WebSphere Administration Domain, open the Resources tree.</li>
  <li>Open the JDBC Drivers tree.</li>
  <li>Open the JDBC Driver you want to replace. The list of DataSources defined for this driver displays.</li>
  <li>Click on the name of the DataSource that you want to trace with P6Spy. The configuration page for that DataSource displays.</li>
  <li>Before making any changes, make a note of the values for the following fields:  DatabaseName  Default User  Default Password</li>
  <li>Click Properties to view the Driver Specific properties. Each of the items displayed in the table is a setting that the driver needs in order to connect to the database. Make a note of the name and value of each item. In our MySQL example, these properties are as follows:  port 3306  serverName myhost</li>
  <li>Navigate to the previous page (the configuration page for the driver), and change the JNDI Name for the DataSource. For example, if the DataSource JNDI name is MySqlDS, change it to RealMySqlDS.</li>
  <li>Click JDBC Drivers (in the left panel), to open the list of Drivers.</li>
  <li>Click New to open a configuration page for a new driver.</li>
  <li>Accept the User-defined JDBC Driver selection.</li>
  <li>Click Next.</li>
  <li>Fill in the table with the following values:  Server Class Path = path_to_p6spy.jar  Name = P6SpyDriver  Description = P6Spy JDBC tracing driver  Implementation Classname = com.p6spy.engine.spy.P6ConnectionPoolDataSource</li>
  <li>Click OK. The list of drivers, which contains your new driver specifications, displays.</li>
  <li>Open the new JDBC Drivers tree, which contains P6SpyDriver, in the left panel.</li>
  <li>Open the Data Sources folder.</li>
  <li>Click New to create a new DataSource for P6SpyDriver.</li>
  <li>Set this DataSource up like the original configuration for your target driver (the one that you earlier recorded in your notes), except for two things: the DataSource name and the Driver Specific properties. Use something different for the DataSource name, and do not set any Driver Specific properties.</li>
  <li>Save the configuration.</li>
  <li><p>Configure the spy.properties file. Assuming that your names match the ones used above, and that you are using the MySQL driver from mysql.com, your DataSource related entries should look like the following examples:  realdatasource=RealMySqlDS  prealdatasourceclass=com.mysql.jdbc.jdbc2.optional.MysqlDataSource  realdatasourceproperties=port;3306,serverName;myhost</p><p>Note: The items in realdatasourceproperties are the items that you recorded from the Driver Specific properties in your original DataSource configuration.</p></li>
  <li><p>Modify the realdriver line in the spy.properties file to reflect the wrapped database driver (com.mysql.Driver, in our example). An example of a modified realdriver line follows:  realdriver=com.mysql.Driver</p></li>
  <li>Move the spy.properties file to the WebSphere/AppServer/properties directory.</li>

Note that since you typically write or otherwise obtain your own Connection Pool when using Resin, these instructions will differ by application. To install P6Spy on Resin, complete the following steps:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
  <li>Extract the p6spy-install.jar file. The p6spy-install.jar file contains p6spy.jar and spy.properties.</li>
  <li>Move the p6spy.jar and spy.properties files to the lib directory. An example of the path to your lib directory is C:\resin-2.1.6\webapps\your_app_name\WEB-INF\lib, where your_app_name is the name of your application.</li>
  <li><p>Modify Resin to use P6SpyDriver. Resin applications obtain their JDBC connection in a variety of ways. Most applications have the database driver name externalized as a configuration parameter. For example, in your web.xml file (which may reside in C:\resin-2.1.6\webapps\your_app_name\WEB-INF) you may have something similar to the following:    db.driver  <!-- mysql (mm driver) -->  org.gjt.mm.mysql.Driver  </p><p>In the above case, the db.driver parameter has a value of org.gjt.mm.mysql.Driver, which is the MySQL driver. Wherever this configuration information is stored, change the driver name (org.gjt.mm.mysql.Driver, in our example) to com.p6spy.engine.spy.P6SpyDriver, as in the following example:    db.driver  <!-- mysql (mm driver) -->  com.p6spy.engine.spy.P6SpyDriver  </p></li>
  <li><p>Modify the realdriver line in the spy.properties file to reflect the wrapped database driver. An example of a modified realdriver line (using MySQL as the driver) follows:</p>
  <div class="source"><pre>realdriver = org.gjt.mm.mysql.Driver
</pre></div></li>
  <li><p>In your start-up script (for Unix), or startup command-line (for Windows), enable Resin to locate spy.properties. While all of the JAR files in your lib directory are, by default, included in Resins classpath, the lib directory itself is not. This means Resin will not be able to find your spy.properties file, which will result in an error. So, you must include spy.properties in the Resin classpath. Use Resins command-line argument to specify the location of the spy.properties file. An example of passing p6.home environment variable as a command-line argument to Resins httpd on Windows follows:  C:\resin-2.1.6\bin\httpd  - -Dp6.home=C:\resin-2.1.6\webapps\your_app_name\WEB-INF\lib</p></li>
</ol><p>Installation is complete. When you run your application, a log file (spy.log) is generated in the directory from which you launched the application.

  <li>Extract the p6spy-install.jar file. The p6spy-install.jar file contains p6spy.jar and spy.properties.</li>
  <li>Put the p6spy.jar file in your classpath by copying the p6spy.jar file into your ext directory. If you are using an EJB server it probably has its own ext directory. If you are not using an EJB server, then use the JDK ext directory, which is JDK_HOME/jre/lib/ext, or add p6spy.jar to your classpath. Remember that if you are adding p6spy.jar to your classpath, you must reference the JAR filename directly. An example of the path in Microsoft Windows follows:  CLASSPATH=c:\p6spy\p6spy.jar Note: If you are using an EJB server, adding the p6spy.jar file to your classpath may not work. Some EJB servers ignore the classpath, setting their own on startup.</li>
  <li>Move spy.properties into a directory listed in your classpath. For example, if your classpath is C:\p6spy\p6spy.jar;c:\java, copy it to the java directory. Unlike JAR files, you do not directly reference your property file in the classpath.</li>
  <li>Modify your application server or application to use the P6Spy database driver.</li>
