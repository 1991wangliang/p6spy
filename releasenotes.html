        <h1>Release Notes</h1>
<div class="section">
<h2>Version 1.2<a name="Version_1.2"></a></h2>

<ul>
  
<li>Driver initialization bug fix and package import cleanup contributed by Joe Fisher (Joe Fisher)</li>
  
<li>Further changes to better support JDK 1.2</li>
  
<li>Changed a DataSource class name to avoid conflict with an Oracle class of the same name (Alan Arvesen of IronGrid)</li>
  
<li>Allow unlimited SQL parameters (Bradley Johnson of IronGrid)</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="section">
<h2>Version 1.1<a name="Version_1.1"></a></h2>

<ul>
  
<li>Added a highly requested feature contributed by Jeff Wolfe that only logs queries taking longer than a specified threshold. (Jeff Wolfe)</li>
  
<li>Added a bug fix that prevented modified property files from being persisted in Java environments prior to 1.4. (Jeff Wolfe)</li>
  
<li>Added JBoss 2.x JMX support, submitted by Ralph Harnden (Ralph Harnden)</li>
  
<li>Alan Arvesen of IronGrid added a driver patch that deregisters realdrivers using the same name as the P6 driver to avoid driver order registration problems (Alan Arvesen)</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="section">
<h2>Version 1.0.1<a name="Version_1.0.1"></a></h2>

<ul>
  
<li>Added a bug fix to prevent a NullPointerException from being thrown when there is a space before or after the name of the realdriver. (Paolo De Carlo)</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="section">
<h2>Version 1.0 Production Release<a name="Version_1.0_Production_Release"></a></h2>

<ul>
  
<li>In beta for over 6 months, P6Spy version 1.0 is a major rewrite of the P6Spy code. This release includes numerous new features, such as support for JDK 1.4, Datasources, log4j, JBoss 3.x, and WebSphere, as well as an overhauled, optimized architecture.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="section">
<h2>Version 1.0 beta 9<a name="Version_1.0_beta_9"></a></h2>

<ul>
  
<li>Added full support for DataSources and created installation instructions for WebSphere 4.0. (Dennis Parker, IronGrid)</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="section">
<h2>Version 1.0 beta 8<a name="Version_1.0_beta_8"></a></h2>

<ul>
  
<li>Refactored options to support easier creation of new option files and clearer separation of file management from management of the actual properties.</li>
  
<li>Reduced deployment JAR file size by 25%.</li>
  
<li>P6Spy Documentation was overhauled. (Suzanne Patton)</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="section">
<h2>Version 1.0 beta 7<a name="Version_1.0_beta_7"></a></h2>

<ul>
  
<li>Created code to enable more robust property file loading, including the ability to use the ClassLoader to load the property file. (Scott Howlett)</li>
  
<li>Fixed a problem dealing with the log file being ignored.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="section">
<h2>Version 1.0 beta 6<a name="Version_1.0_beta_6"></a></h2>

<ul>
  
<li>Debugged and fixed a problem in which applications calling newInstance(), instead of using DriverManager, were causing the driver to load improperly.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="section">
<h2>Version 1.0 beta 5<a name="Version_1.0_beta_5"></a></h2>

<ul>
  
<li>Refactored the driver loading to first attempt the new classloader mechanism (implemented in Version 1 beta 2) and, upon failure, attempt the previously-used Name loading call. (Alan Arvesen, IronGrid)</li>
  
<li>P6SpyDriver now throws an exception immediately when realdriver fails to load, making diagnostics easier.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="section">
<h2>Version 1.0 beta 4<a name="Version_1.0_beta_4"></a></h2>

<ul>
  
<li>Added error category and pushed error logging through the standard logging process instead of stderr. This should make it easier to diagnose problems when installation does not proceed as expected.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="section">
<h2>Version 1.0 beta 3<a name="Version_1.0_beta_3"></a></h2>

<ul>
  
<li>Added a call to each P6 class called getJDBC() that returns the native driver. This enables a workaround for using non-standard JDBC calls included with some JDBC drivers. See Known Issues for more information. Thanks to Ralph Harnden for the suggestion. (Alan Arvesen, IronGrid)</li>
  
<li>Added an appender architecture which supports customizable logging. (Alan Arvesen, IronGrid)</li>
  
<li>Changed the reloading code to work as a separate thread, making it more efficient. (Alan Arvesen, IronGrid)</li>
  
<li>Enhanced module support, making it easier to create a new module. Now, the only required files for a new module are the factory, the driver, and the classes that are changing. If you want to intercept the Statement class only, that is the only class you need to create. In the past, you had to create an instance of every class, even if you did not want to override that class. The code to support driver loading has also been simplified.</li>
  
<li>Added JDK 1.4 support. (Matthew Wakeling)</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="section">
<h2>Version 1.0 beta 1 &amp; 2<a name="Version_1.0_beta_1__2"></a></h2>

<ul>
  
<li>Added log4j support, which is one of the most requested feature enhancements. (Rafael Alvarez)</li>
  
<li>Due to problems reported with driver loading in the alpha version, driver loading has been rewritten. It is now more efficient.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="section">
<h2>Version 1.0 alpha<a name="Version_1.0_alpha"></a></h2>

<ul>
  
<li>Restructured code to inherit from a single core wrapper driver.</li>
  
<li>Introduced concepts of modules and stackable drivers that dynamically load the necessary code into memory at runtime.</li>
  
<li>Broke code into logical modules: P6Log and P6Outage.</li>
  
<li>Refactored large amount of code.</li>
  
<li>Rewrote JUnit tests and added more rigorous tests.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="section">
<h2>Version 0.8<a name="Version_0.8"></a></h2>

<ul>
  
<li>Created an Outage Detection module that reports database outages when database statements do not respond within a given period of time. (Peter Laird)</li>
  
<li>Created a JSP application that gives a visual control to P6Spy. The first version can be used to view configuration information about P6Spy and to create a demarcation in the log file. (Peter Laird)</li>
  
<li>Added support for multiple simultaneous databases, a highly requested feature. Currently, support is limited to three databases, but can easily be expanded. (Viktor Szathmary)</li>
  
<li>Added the logging of a connection ID, and enabled URLs to be prefixed with p6spy: to aid in debugging. A common mistake people make when installing is to have the real driver registered elsewhere; this feature avoids that problem. The default does not require this value, but in the future it may be mandatory to ease the install process.</li>
  
<li>Rewrote P6SpyOptions to allow new options to be added quickly and easily.</li>
  
<li>Additional JUnit tests added.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="section">
<h2>Version 0.72<a name="Version_0.72"></a></h2>

<ul>
  
<li>Added the ability to dynamically reload the property file after a specified period of time. (Philip Ogren)</li>
  
<li>Added logging to commit and rollback statements.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="section">
<h2>Version 0.71<a name="Version_0.71"></a></h2>

<ul>
  
<li>Added installation instructions for BEA WebLogic Portal and Server. (Philip Ogren)</li>
  
<li>Added Jakarta RegExp support. (Philip Ogren)</li>
  
<li>Ability to print stack trace of logged statements. This is useful in understanding where a logged query is being executed in the application. (Philip Ogren)</li>
  
<li>Simplified table monitoring property file option. (Philip Ogren)</li>
  
<li>Updated the RegExp documentation.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="section">
<h2>Version 0.7<a name="Version_0.7"></a></h2>

<ul>
  
<li>Added timing information to the log files, in order to better visualize bottleneck queries. (Simon Sadedin)</li>
  
<li>Added RegExp support for table filtering, allowing sophisticated custom filtering. (Simon Sadedin)</li>
  
<li>Added installation instructions for Sun iPlanet. (Michael Sgroi)</li>
  
<li>Added installation instructions for BEA WebLogic. (Richard Delbert)</li>
  
<li>Added support for callable statements.</li>
  
<li>Added support for batch statements.</li>
  
<li>Added a debug category that provides detailed debug information. By default, this is disabled. Refer to the Troubleshooting section for more information.</li>
  
<li>Changed the default log format to include more information.</li>
  
<li>Added a test target to Ant that works with JUnit to perform some basic tests, using Oracle as the test database.</li>
  
<li>Added ResultSet logging and timing information. By default, this is disabled. Refer to the Log File Format documentation for more information.</li>
  
<li>Fixed a number of bugs, in particular a bug that was causing an empty spy.log file to be created and never populated.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="section">
<h2>Version 0.6<a name="Version_0.6"></a></h2>

<ul>
  
<li>Fixed a bug in which null connections were not returning null, but rather empty connections. This was a problem for some applications that were expecting a null connection.</li>
  
<li>Added an option to allow the truncation/non-truncation of the log file, which can be specified within spy.options.</li>
